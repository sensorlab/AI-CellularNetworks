# AI/ML Integration in 5G and Beyond: Architecture and Prototypes

## 📚 Description

Following the 3GPP perspective, in this tutorial, we start from 5G CN and move towards 5G RAN, focusing on AI/ML impact on 5G and B5G physical layer design. We also cover complementary work done by Open RAN (O-RAN) Alliance. We also include several use cases and applications of AI/ML integration in 5G/B5G.
